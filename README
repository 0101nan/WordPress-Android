GraphView is a custom View which easily creates Graphs.
Just supply an array of values and they will be displayed in the graph.
The graph automatically scales the values between the highest and the lowest in the supplied set.
Labels are shown along the X and Y axis. 
The first and last label on the X axis are intentionally not centered in order to use less screen space.
